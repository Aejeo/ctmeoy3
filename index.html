            <h1>About</h1>
            <p>Halloween is among the oldest traditions in the world as it touches on an
                essential element of the human condition: the relationship between the living and the
                dead. The observance evolved from ancient rituals marking the transition from summer
                to winter, thereby associating it with transformation, which is still a central theme of the
                holiday.
            </p>
            <p>The
                modern-day observance of Halloween in countries such as the United States and
                Canada – where this tradition is most popular – share in this ancient tradition, even
                though some aspects of the holiday are relatively recent developments, and can be
                traced back to the Celtic festival of Samhain.

                <h2>SAMHAIN</h2>
                <p>
                    Halloween traditions in the West date back thousands of years to the festival of
                    Samhain (pronounced `Soo-when', `So-ween' or `Saw-wen'), the Celtic New Year's
                    festival. The name means “summer's end”, and the festival marked the close of the
                    harvest season and the coming of winter. The Celts believed that the veil between the
                    worlds of the living and the dead were thinnest at this time and so the dead could return
                    and walk where they had before.

                <h2>ALL HALLOWS' EVE</h2>
                <p>
                    How long ago these rituals were included in the observance of Samhain is unknown, but
                    some form of them were probably in place by the time Christianity came to Ireland in the 5th
                    century. The hill of Tlachtga (Hill of the Ward) in County Meath was the site of the bonfire
                    lighted on or around 31 October signaling the beginning of Samhain festivities when it was
                    answered by the much more prominent fire from the Neolithic site of the Hill of Tara across
                    from it. Archaeologists from University College Dublin have dated the excavated earthworks to
                    200 CE but note these are only the latest developments at a site first used for ceremonial fires
                    over 2,000 years ago.

                <h2>CENTRAL THEME</h2>
                <p>
                    For many Neo-Pagans and Wiccans in the modern day, however, the holiday
                    continues to be observed – as closely as possible – as it was in the ancient past. The
                    central theme of Samhain was transformation. The year turned from the light days to the
                    dark, the dead crossed over into the land of the living or moved on to the other side,
                    people disguised themselves as other entities, and entities might appear as people,
                    animals were slaughtered and turned into food while grains, fruits, and vegetables were
                    similarly transformed for winter storage and wood and bone went up in the flames of the
                    bonfires as smoke

            Diabolique (1995)
        </h1>
        <p>The lyrically mesmerising beauty of this film has to do with our witnessing just
            how the hare outfoxes the fox. In other words, how the fox outfoxes itself. Just how
            much the tables are turned on the hunter by its prey; this is the staple technique of this
            wonderful film. Don’t think that I will spoil it for you, for even if one wanted to, Les
            Diaboliques’ plot is far from easy to give away. Besides, when this magnificent film was
            first released, the director and the production company virtually begged moviegoers not
            to reveal the ending. I will honour this request.</p>

        <h1>Godzilla</h1>
       <p> Godzilla is viewed by many as the beginning of both the kaiju genre (movies
        featuring giant creatures) and the start of tokusatsu (live-action work that uses a lot of
        special effects) in film. It’s not just the impact of the franchise by itself that matters, but
        its massive influence on other works is key in understanding why it’s so beloved 60+
        years later.</p>

        <h1>Psycho (1960)</h1>
        <p>In Psycho, Hitchcock allows the audience to become a subjective character
            within the plot to enhance the film’s psychological effects for an audience that is forced
            to recognize its own neurosis and psychological inadequacies as it is compelled to
            identify, for varying lengths of time, with the contrasting personalities of the film’s main
            characters. Hitchcock conveys an intensifying theme in Psycho, that bases itself on the
            unending subconscious battle between good and evil that exists in everyone through
            the audience’s subjective participation and implicit character parallels.</p>

    <div class="movie"id="rosemary">
        <img src="assets/60-rosemary.jpg" alt="">
        <h1>Rosemary (1968)</h1>
        <p>Rosemary's Baby is a pointed critique of the Catholic Church's restrictive
            attitudes surrounding a woman's bodily autonomy. The film plays on Rosemary's fears
            as a Catholic, as well as the Catholic Church's fear of women. Rosemary's Catholicism
            shapes her way of thinking and perceiving—nuns and priests populate her dreams, and
            she grows uncomfortable at Roman's suggestion that the Pope is unworthy of respect. </p>

    <div class="movie"id="hallo">
        <img src="assets/70-hallo.jpg" alt="">
        <h1>HALLOWEEN (1978)</h1>
        <p>Halloween has also been studied as a critique of American social values. Parents
            are unavailable during the duration of the film, unable to protect their children during the
            film’s attacks. A bigger, related theme in Halloween is sex—namely, premarital sex and
            the thematic dangers of the act. Many of the film’s murders take place in juxtaposition
            with sexual acts. The main characters find babysitting an opportunity to drink and
            engage in intercourse, during which each of them is killed. Even the film’s introduction
            shows Michael Myers killing for the first time, murdering his sister after she was too
            busy having sex with her boyfriend to pay attention to him.</p>

    <div class="movie"id="jaws">

        <h1>Jaws (1975)</h1>
        <p>A drunken swimmer ends up a midnight snack … and Jaws’ iconic opening
            scene wastes no time demonstrating what Spielberg’s film is about: the invisible and
            ruthlessly efficient killing machines that lay in wait for us ‘out there’, beyond the rule or
            reason of humans. In pitting Man against Shark, the film reflects the human drive to
            conquer adversity (or just … to conquer). Evading the shark isn’t the only battle,
            however: the film contains an almost infinite number of conflicts – opposing or
            contrasting elements that create tension.</p>

<h1>Poltergeist (1982)</h1>
        <p>Growing up is hard to do, a truth that cinema, literature and society returns to
            time and again. Poltergeist’s haunting builds on this same idea. The film revisits popular
            theories of the time that linked pubescence with poltergeist activity, especially in girls
            (i.e., 1973’s The Exorcist). Even The Waltons – America’s cosiest TV show – saw
            youngest daughter Elizabeth manifest fears of growing up via a haunting.</p>

        <h1>Sleepaway Camp (1983)</h1>
        <p>Robert Hiltzik’s Sleepaway Camp (1983) is an uncommonly touching slasher film,
            even if its political and social viewpoint is dubious (as is true of many films in the horror
            genre). It turns on the interplay between the manifest and the mysterious, wherein there </p>
